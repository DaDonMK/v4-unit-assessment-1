             <div id = "paragraph1">HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web.  
                It is the fifth and last major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. 
                The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard. It is maintained by a consortium of the major 
                browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG)

            <div id = "paragraph2">HTML5 was first released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008, with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" 
                status in October 2014. Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the 
                language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without
                 XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.

            <div class='bottom-paragraph1'>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
                 CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

                Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, 
                by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device. 
                The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element.                  
                This cascading priority scheme is predictable. The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for 
                use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents. In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.
                Inheritance is a key feature in CSS; it relies on the ancestor-descendant relationship to operate. Inheritance is the mechanism by which properties are applied not only to a specified element, but also to its descendants. 
                Inheritance relies on the document tree, which is the hierarchy of XHTML elements in a page based on nesting. Descendant elements may inherit CSS property values from any ancestor element enclosing them. In general, 
                descendant elements inherit text-related properties, but their box-related properties are not inherited.
